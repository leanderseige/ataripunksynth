I thank all the great people out there creating fancy circuits and sharing them with the world. Here are the most important sources I used:

## Circuit

**WARNING!**

I tried to create one single circuit diagram putting it all together. However I am not 100% sure that everyting is correct. Please take it as an inspiration, think and think twice and be skeptical about everyting! This circuit diagram may contain errors. If you're going to build your own Atari Punk Synth, recheck everyting and if you encounter any mistakes please let me know. Build circuits following this design is on your own risk!
