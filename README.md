# Atari Punk Synth

This is a simple synthesizer based on the popular **Atari Punk Console** design. In addition it features:
* 8-Step Sequencer
* Echo/Reverb Unit
* Sync In incl. Frequency Divider
* Sync Out (repeating Sync In only at this time)
* Manual Clock
* Internal Speaker
* Line Out

## Sources

I thank all the great people out there creating fancy circuits and sharing them with the world. Here are the most important sources I used:

Atari Punk Console with 8-Step Sequencer using two 555 and one 4017 can be found here http://www.owyheesound.com/sequencer.php or here https://electro-music.com/forum/topic-37770-125.html This circuit diagram circulates in different versions. Be sure to pick the "November 4th, 2009" version.

## Circuit

**WARNING!**

I tried to create one single circuit diagram putting it all together. However I am not 100% sure that everything is correct. Please take it as an inspiration, think and think twice and be skeptical about everything! This circuit diagram may contain errors. If you're going to build your own Atari Punk Synth, recheck everything and if you encounter any mistakes please let me know. Building circuits following this design is on your own risk!
